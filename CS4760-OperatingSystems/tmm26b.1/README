README for project 1 Operating Systems with Professor Hauschild. 
Most of the code was copied from exercise 3.8 in Robin's book on Unix Programming per the assignment specifications, and then modified. At first I tried to set up Git using Professor Bhatia's online guide, but changed to use RCS because I found it much easier. 
To compile and run the project: type "make" while in the project's directory. This will create an executable called ass1. Great opportunity to make a joke about the executable name, but professionalism is more important than laughs in this situation. Next, type "./ass1" while still in the project directory to run the program. The program takes in 3 different command line arguments. To get help, type "./ass1 -h" when running the program, and a help menu will spawn showing the other possible options. The other options are: "./ass1 -n #" where # is an integer, and "./ass1 -p" displays an error message using perror.
