I chose option 3. FSA table + driver. 

The FSA table is in file: scanner.cpp

The driver is in file: testScanner.cpp --> function is called: void testScanner(std::ifstream& infile)

The scanner is in file scanner.cpp

For testing: do not enter file name for keyboard inpput. Or enter filenames P1_test or P2_test or P3_test.
